If we want to look into police info:
Our data does not have police info.  The average response time is probably published somewhere.
Here is info from 2004: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/10/20040510-122711-8996r/?page=all
Can probably find avg. time for 2013 but probably not coordinates.
