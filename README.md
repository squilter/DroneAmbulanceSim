Data taken from [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BytkaupSbV7SSnpBV19WcG1nQ0E&usp=sharing), compiled by [this](https://github.com/codefordc/ERDA) project.


GUI version prerequisites:
Python 2-7
pygame 1.9.2 for 2.7 ( pygame.org/downloads ) 32-bit version


If we want to look into police info:
Our data does not have police info.  The average response time is probably published somewhere.
Here is info from 2004: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/10/20040510-122711-8996r/?page=all
Can probably find avg. time for 2013 but probably not coordinates.
